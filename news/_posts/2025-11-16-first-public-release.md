Today, almost three years after we started working on OpenE2140, we're proud to announce that the first public version of OpenE2140 is out.

**TL;DR:** If you can't wait to play, head over to [Download page]({% link download.html %}) for links and [How To Install page]({% link install.md %}) for instructions on how to install and start playing OpenE2140. We do recommend reading the release notes below as they contain useful information.

### Multiplayer alpha

While the game is fully playable, it is still an early access alpha release — OpenE2140 is not complete. That said, most of the gameplay and UI features are implemented. Since the AI isn't available (yet), the main focus of this release is multiplayer.

We understand that this might be a bit disappointing for some people — Earth 2140 was mainly a single-player game after all. However, making AI work with the specifics of Earth 2140 (mainly base building) is going to take some time. We've focused on adding as many gameplay features as possible before making this public release, because that's what's actually most important: without units and buildings, you can't really play an RTS like Earth 2140.

We think your ability to play multiplayer games with others may actually be interesting, because only the old DOS version of Earth 2140 had multiplayer — and even that was hard to get working (all Windows versions came without multiplayer and never received it after release).

We've set up dedicated multiplayer servers, which you can use to play OpenE2140 with other people over the internet. They're all located in Czech Republic (Europe). We will add more if these are not going to be enough:

### Main changes from Earth 2140

The first thing you'll notice when you start OpenE2140 is that the UI is different from the original. For some people, it might take a while to get familiar with it, but players with experience in C&C games (especially modern ones like C&C3: Tiberium Wars) will recognize it and get used to it quickly.

As for gameplay, expect what you saw in the launch trailer above — unit production queues, unit stances, HCU-M automatic repair, automatic ore transport, and more! We'll post a list of changes and improvements soon.

### Missing features and other known issues

As mentioned before, OpenE2140 is not complete. There are many features yet to be implemented, bugs to fix, and UI elements to polish. However, most of these are minor and don't affect the overall feel of the game.

The biggest missing feature is the AI. While you can start a Skirmish game, there's no AI player yet. Skirmish is still useful, though — you can try everything out at your own pace and then perhaps play online with other people.

For more information on known issues, head over to [Known issues page]({% link known-issues.md %}) to find out what to expect from this release. You don't have to worry, though; we intend to finish remaking Earth 2140 in its entirety, so everything from that list will be fixed and/or implemented eventually.

### Versioning

As mentioned, OpenE2140 is currently in the multiplayer alpha phase. For versioning, we've decided to follow OpenRA's scheme:

**release-yyyyMMdd**, where yyyyMMdd is the release date in the format year, month, day.

Therefore the current version is `release-20251116`.

### Feedback

This is the first time you get to play OpenE2140 and we'd really appreciate your feedback. We did receive some over the past two years, but that feedback was based only on videos and screenshots of what we've shown you, without you actually playing the game.
