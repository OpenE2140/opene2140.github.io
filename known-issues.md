# Release notes and known issues

**OpenE2140 is far from finished**. Therefore there are still bugs, issues, and other items that are either not implemented or not working correctly. They are listed below and are either gameplay-related and/or more visible in general (i.e., players are likely to see them in the game). Apart from these, there are some other minor visual issues. We **plan to finish and fix** all of them eventually.

For the high-level overview of development plan [see the Roadmap page]({% link roadmap.md %}).

                The major feature currently missing <strong>is the AI for skirmish</strong> and multiplayer games. We <strong>are aware</strong> that it is a highly <strong>desired feature</strong> and we're working on including it in a future release. Please note that AI in RTS games is difficult to implement, so it may not be very sophisticated (if at all).

Creating duplicate issues slows us down and won't speed up the process of fixing them. If you experience the problem or have more information to provide, please add a comment to an existing issue (you'll need a GitHub account for that).

In the list below, you can find links to relevant GitHub issues for more information.

## Known issues

- A very rare out-of-sync bug in multiplayer related to Miners can instantly end the match.
- On Windows systems with high-DPI displays (more than 100% scaling), the game may be partially rendered outside the screen bounds. Try one of the following workarounds, then increase UI scaling in OpenE2140's settings:
    - Disable scaling in the compatibility options for the OpenE2140 executable.
    - Disable scaling in Windows display settings (i.e., set to 100%).
- Original installation CDs as a source for game assets are not supported (see [How To Install page]({% link install.md %}) for instructions on installing OpenE2140).


## Completely missing stuff
- AI
- single-player campaign
- offensive/defensive AI generals (which make a group of units autonomously defend or attack)


## Not implemented stuff
- SDI Defense building cannot destroy incoming nuclear missiles ([#642](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/642))
- Miners cannot disarm mines ([#318](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/318))
- explosions and flammable grenades don't cause actual fire that spreads and damages everything it touches ([#154](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/154))
    - i.e., the fire is currently just a visual effect
- ED's nuclear missile does not have a thruster trail ([#438](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/438))
- vehicles/mechs cannot enter Shelter ([#389](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/389))


## Incorrectly working features
- vehicles transported in WTP 100 and WTRN are not visible and cannot attack ([#652](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/pull/652))
- HCU-M captures of disabled vehicles instantly ([#274](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/274))
- Mech walking sounds and Heavy Lifter moving sounds play even when the game is paused ([#574](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/574))
- HT 30 LR rocket launchers don't work independently of lasers ([#184](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/184))
- KT 30 heavy rocket launcher doesn't work independently of the light rocket launcher ([#184](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/184))
- When HT 30 LR is ordered to attack, it won't get close enough to the target for the laser cannons to start firing; i.e., only its rocket launchers will fire ([#185](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/185))
    - Lasers *will* start firing when the HT 30 LR gets a little closer.
- HT 30 LR lasers can fire at different targets ([#208](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/208))
- KT 30 ship's rocket launchers have incorrect positions ([#270](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/270))
- Transporter units (ATM 500, TUR, HAT, WTRN, WTP 100) don't have load/unload animations, nor do they load or unload units like in Earth 2140 ([#246](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/246))
    - i.e., the transporters don't rotate and transported units don't enter or leave from specific directions
- Shelter does not have an opening/closing animation
- The rectangle shown when ordering an attack (attack flash animation) has an incorrect color ([#237](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues/237))
- Selection boxes have a different shape and color compared to those in the original game
