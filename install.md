# How to install OpenE2140?

## Original game

To play OpenE2140, you must own a licensed copy of the original Earth 2140 game. OpenE2140 uses many of the original game's assets (sprites, tiles, sounds, etc.), which are owned by TopWare Interactive and remain under copyright protection. As a result, we cannot distribute these files--you must provide them yourself. You can buy the the original games from these digital stores:

- [Earth 2140 Trilogy (GOG)](https://www.gog.com/game/earth_2140_trilogy)
- [Earth 2140 (Steam)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/253860/Earth_2140/)
- [Earth 2140 (Zoom Platform)](https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/earth-2140-trilogy)
- [Earth 2140 (TopWare Interactive Shop)](https://www.topwareshop.com/index.php?id_product=36&controller=product&id_lang=3)

## OpenE2140

Download and install OpenE2140 from the [Download page]({% link download.html %}), according to your platform. These operating systems are supported:

- Windows 10/11
- macOS 10.15 and above
- Linux (any modern, reasonably recent distribution will do)

OpenE2140 also runs on Windows 7 and 8.1, but these versions are not officially supported (Microsoft has dropped support for them) and OpenE2140 may stop working on them at any time. Use at your own risk.

## Installing the game assets

After installing OpenE2140, you will need to supply the original game assets. Currently, only the digital versions are officially supported.

**TODO: screenshot: mod content manager**

After installing the original game via the official clients of these stores, OpenE2140 can automatically detect and copy the necessary content from your installation.

To install the assets, open "Manage Content" from the main game menu and press "Detect Disc or Installation." This is the recommended method.

CD versions are not officially supported. If you have a CD version, you will need to install the assets manually. Please see the [manual installation section](#manual-installation) below for instructions.

## Demo version
{: #demo-version}

OpenE2140 requires the full set of assets from the original game, including Mission Pack 2 (due to the new units and buildings it introduces). Therefore **demo versions are not supported**, because they lack not only the Mission Pack 2 content but also other essential assets required for proper gameplay (such as specific tilesets and additional units/buildings). As a result, the demo versions are incomplete and cannot be used with OpenE2140.

While this is unfortunate for people wanting to just try out OpenE2140, it is understandable due to the fact that the demo is very limited and was released alongside **of the original, base game** (which couldn't contain the new assets from Mission Pack 2).

# How to manually install game assets?
{: #manual-installation}

**TODO: update based on the actual behavior)**

Warning: this method is not recommended and should only be used if the automatic installation fails. Success with manual installation cannot be guaranteed. Use at your own risk.

Warning: The automatic installation may fail for non-English content. OpenE2140 does not support other languages at the current stage of development. While it is possible to copy, for example, sound files or music from non-English versions, this is not officially supported and may cause problems.

If you encounter issues with automatic installation, contact the developers via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/issues) or the [OpenE2140 Discord server](https://discord.gg/KNcX5BxA37).

As mentioned before, OpenE2140 requires the full set of game assets (including those from Mission Pack 2). Not all CD disks contain these files. If you already have a CD version of Earth 2140, check carefully that all required files are present. The presence of `LEVEL2.WD` is a strong indicator that the CD includes Mission Pack 2 and is likely compatible with OpenE2140.

In addition to these mandatory assets, you can optionally install music tracks from the Steam and GOG versions to play in the integrated music player.

OpenE2140 is based on OpenRA, which stores game files in the following folders depending on your platform:

* Windows: `%APPDATA%\OpenRA\Content\`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRA/Content/`
* Linux: `~/.config/openra/Content/`
* For portable installations: `Support\Content\` inside your `OpenRA` installation folder (create the folders if necessary)

The required files for OpenE2140 must be placed in a folder named `e2140`; otherwise, the game will not find them and will show the asset installation screen.

Note for Linux users: Linux filesystems are case-sensitive, so you must rename filenames to uppercase.

## Mandatory files

- FLC.WD
- FONT.WD
- GRAPH.WD
- MENU.WD
- MIX.WD
- PIRO.WD
- SMP0.WD
- SMP1.WD

## Music files

As mentioned earlier, music files are optional and must be placed in a specific subfolder within the `Content` folder, and must be named correctly. Here is a list of the files, their sources, and required names:

**TODO: update the list for all music tracks including the vocal soundtrack and other information**

Mission Pack 2 - Track 11.mp3

**TODO: screenshot with contents of the `e2140/music` folder**

You do not have to copy all music files—just the ones you want. Here's how the music player looks in OpenE2140:
